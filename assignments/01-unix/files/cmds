   53       compliance with his measures.
   54       He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for
   55       opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of
   56       the people.
   57       He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to
   58       cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers,
   59       incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at
   60       large for their exercise; the state remaining in the meantime
   61       exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and
   62       convulsions within.
   63       He has endeavored to prevent the population of these
   64       states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for
   65       naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to
   66       encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions
   67       of new appropriations of lands.
   68       He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing
   69       his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.
   70       He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the
   71       tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their
   72       salaries.
   73       He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither
   74       swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their
   75       substance.
   76       He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies
   77       without the consent of our legislature.
   78       He has affected to render the military independent of and
   79       superior to civil power.
   80       He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction
   81       foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our
   82       laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:
   83       For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
   84       For protecting them, by mock trial, from punishment for
   85       any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants
   86       of these states:
   87       For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:
   88       For imposing taxes on us without our consent:
   89       For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of trial by
   90       jury:
   91       For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended
   92       offenses:
   93       For abolishing the free system of English laws in a
   94       neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary
   95       government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it
   96       at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the
   97       same absolute rule in these colonies:
   98       For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable
   99       laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our
  100       governments:
  101       For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring
  102       themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all
  103       cases whatsoever.
  104       He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of
  105       his protection and waging war against us.
  106       He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burned
  107       our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
  108       He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign
  109       mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation
  110       and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty
  111       and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages,
  112       and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation.
  113       He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the
  114       high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the
  115       executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall
  116       themselves by their hands.
  117       He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has
  118       endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the
  119       merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare, is
  120       undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and
  121       conditions.
  122  In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the 
  123  most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by 
  124  repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which 
  125  may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
  126  Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have 
  127  warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an 
  128  unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the 
  129  circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to 
  130  their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties 
  131  of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably 
  132  interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the 
  133  voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce 
  134  in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold 
  135  the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.
  136  We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in 
  137  General Congress, assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for 
  138  the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of 
  139  the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these 
  140  united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; 
  141  that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that 
  142  all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain, is and 
  143  ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they 
  144  have full power to levey war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish 
  145  commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may 
  146  of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance 
  147  on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our
