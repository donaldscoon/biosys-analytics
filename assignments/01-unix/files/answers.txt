* You might have expected that the total number of lines in the previous question would be 45 (15 * 3), but it should not be. Why is it more or less?
Title lines between outputs from the each file. And I have an extra 15 from answers.txt. So my command read 4 files instead of 3. But was still over by 7 lines.

* Remove the file called "foo"
$ rm foo.txt

* "git add -A files" and then commit and push. Ensure you can see your new files on Github.
